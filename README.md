**Description**:
This application allows consumers to search complaints submitted to the CFPB by other consumers.

#### Technology Stack
This application is written in JavaScript and [Less](http://lesscss.org) within
the [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/) + [Redux](http://redux.js.org/) 
framework.  It uses [Webpack](http://webpack.github.io/docs/) at runtime to 
manage module loading.

The code is written with the [ES6](http://es6-features.org/) feature set
of JavaScript. Backwards compatibility is achieved by compiling the script with
[Babel](https://babeljs.io/) prior to using it within the browser.

Unit testing of the application is performed within
[Jest](https://facebook.github.io/jest/) with
[Enzyme](http://airbnb.io/enzyme/index.html) providing support for event testing.

[npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) is used to manage the build/test/deploy cycle.

The `ccdb5_ui` (note the underscore) directory contains a thin [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/)
implementation that allows it to be used as a plugin for
[CFPB's public website](https://github.com/cfpb/cfgov-refresh).
